# Multi-class Weather Image Classification

## Project Overview
This project develops machine learning models to classify images into different weather conditions. Using TensorFlow and Keras, the project demonstrates the building, training, and evaluation of models including a basic convolutional model and MobileNet.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains images categorized into various weather conditions. Each image is labeled with its respective weather condition, facilitating a supervised learning approach.

## Models
- **Basic Convolutional Model**: A simple CNN model built from scratch.
- **MobileNet**: A pre-trained MobileNet model fine-tuned for our specific task.

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate the models:

## Results
The MobileNet model outperformed the basic convolutional model, achieving an accuracy of approximately 96.45% on the test set.
